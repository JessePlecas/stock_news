# stock_news
App providing stock news monitoring. 
The purpose of this app was to further my understanding of using API's and being capable of reading through the documentation and implementing it correctly. In this app I am calling on two different APIs and pulling data from both to be sent as a text message containing data from the stock market API and data from the News API. 
In order to run this you will need to enter API key details and Twilio details.
